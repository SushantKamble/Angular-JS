AngularJS History
-----------------
AngularJS version 1.0 was released in 2012.

Miško Hevery, a Google employee, started to work with AngularJS in 2009.

The idea turned out very well, and the project is now officially supported by Google.

Why
---

how to use client-side data binding to build dynamic views of data that change immediately in response to user actions.

Angular keeps your views in sync with your data without the need for DOM manipulation.

how to use dependency injection and services to make common web tasks, such as getting data into your app, easier.


syntax
-------
AngularJS is a JavaScript framework. It can be added to an HTML page with a <script> tag.

AngularJS extends HTML attributes with Directives, and binds data to HTML with Expressions.

AngularJS is a JavaScript Framework
AngularJS is a JavaScript framework. It is a library written in JavaScript.

AngularJS is distributed as a JavaScript file, and can be added to a web page with a script tag:
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.4.8/angular.min.js"></script>



example
-------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.4.8/angular.min.js"></script>
<body>

<div ng-app="">
 	<p>Name: <input type="text" ng-model="name"></p>
 	<p ng-bind="name"></p>
</div>

</body>
</html>

AngularJS starts automatically when the web page has loaded.

The ng-app directive tells AngularJS that the <div> element is the "owner" of an AngularJS application.

The ng-model directive binds the value of the input field to the application variable name.

The ng-bind directive binds the innerHTML of the <p> element to the application variable name.


AngularJS Directives
As you have already seen, AngularJS directives are HTML attributes with an ng prefix.

The ng-init directive initializes AngularJS application variables.
example
-------
<div ng-app="" ng-init="firstName='John'">

<p>The name is <span ng-bind="firstName"></span></p>

</div>

Alternatively with valid HTML:
<div data-ng-app="" data-ng-init="firstName='John'">

<p>The name is <span data-ng-bind="firstName"></span></p>

</div>

AngularJS Expressions
AngularJS expressions are written inside double braces: {{ expression }}.

AngularJS will "output" data exactly where the expression is written:
example
-------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.4.8/angular.min.js"></script>
<body>

<div ng-app="">
 	<p>My first expression: {{ 5 + 5 }}</p>
</div>

</body>
</html>

AngularJS expressions bind AngularJS data to HTML the same way as the ng-bind directive.
