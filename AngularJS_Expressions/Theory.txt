AngularJS Expressions

AngularJS binds data to HTML using Expressions.

AngularJS Expressions
AngularJS expressions can be written inside double braces: {{ expression }}.

AngularJS expressions can also be written inside a directive: ng-bind="expression".

AngularJS will resolve the expression, and return the result exactly where the expression is written.

AngularJS expressions are much like JavaScript expressions: They can contain literals, operators, and variables.

Example {{ 5 + 5 }} or {{ firstName + " " + lastName }}
